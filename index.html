		<p> My name is Kamran Ghandhy, I am currently 16 years old and attending Ayala High School. I enjoy playing water polo and swim. My favorite things to do besides sports are playing video games and hanging out with my freinds late at night. When i grow up I want to become an engineer. Some life goals of mine are to buy my dream car, have kids, and buy a nice house.
